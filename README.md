Information to Binary....?

Binary is a number system that uses only two digits: 0 and 1. It is also called the base-2 number system. Here's a simple explanation:


ðŸ”¢ What is Binary?

Binary is the way computers understand and store data. Unlike the decimal system (base-10), which uses digits 0â€“9, binary only uses:

0 (off)

1 (on)

Each digit in a binary number is called a bit.


ðŸ“˜ Example:

Decimal number 5 in binary is:

5 = 101 (in binary)
Total = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5

ðŸ’» Why Binary Is Important?

Computers use binary because digital circuits have two states: on (1) and off (0).

All programs, images, videos, and data are stored in binary format.
